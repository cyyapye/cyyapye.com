# About

I write The Engineering Handbook \[link] to record how I run software engineering organizations. I write opportunistically here about other topics of interest to me.

There's no snow in Malaysia where I grew up. When I had to pick between Austin, Tempe, and Buffalo for college, it was an easy choice. Until I learned about lake effect snow. I now live in Southern California.

As a kid, I almost drowned even though I knew how to swim and was two feet from the pool's edge. Later, I saved a kid and one of my college friends from drowning on two separate occasions.

I read anything that piques my interest. I walk, hike, and run. When reading or moving, I stare at my bonsai.
